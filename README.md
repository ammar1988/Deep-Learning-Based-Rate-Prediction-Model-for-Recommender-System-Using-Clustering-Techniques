Deep Learning-Based Rate Prediction Model for Recommender System Using Clustering Techniques

By Dr. Ammar Abdulsalam Al-Asadi

This project proposed a novel cluster-based denoising autoencoder model (cluster-based DAE) for rate prediction recommender systems. Instead of building a single model, it builds K models by using k-means algorithm to divide the users into groups based on their preferences. Each group trains a DAE model to generate recommendations for itsmembers. 
The proposed method was trained and tested with MovieLens datasets where 80% of the data are used for training and 20% for testing. 
The performance of the proposed method compared againstother state-of-the-art methods that use deep learning to build rate prediction models. It outperformed the other compared methods in term of mean absolute error and root mean squared error.
